    <h2> Cover Letter </h2>

    <p> Dear sir/madam, <br> 
        First I want to thank you for coming onto my page, here I will explain why I would be a good candidate for this role I have applied for. <br>
        All the code used on this website will be available for checking in my github <a href="https://github.com/Mangoccino/MC.git" target="_blank">repository</a>. Along with my commit log. <br>
        <br>

        <strong>I believe in showing you what I can do, so I have made this website</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>
        Why didn't I do a bachelors degree?
    </h2>
    <p>
        I believe in investing in my future, however due to being a New Zealand Citizen and the lack of HECS HELP, I am unable to afford doing a bachelors degree. I will admit the graduate certificate course at the University of Newcastle was a government subsidied course, and I am very grateful to be able to try and pursue my dreams of changing careers, with this opportunity.
    </p>
